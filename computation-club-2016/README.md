I ran a code retreat as a meeting for the [London Computation
Club](http://london.computation.club/) in April 2016.

You can [read about our adventures](https://github.com/computationclub/computationclub.github.io/wiki/The-New-Turing-Omnibus-Chapter-44-Cellular-Automata)
or you can look at the 3 implementations I was involved with:

1. [The JS implementation](https://github.com/h-lame/computationclub/tree/gh-pages/nto/conway) I wrote beforehand to show off the game-of-life. You can [see it live here](http://h-lame.github.io/computationclub/nto/conway/)
2. [The ruby implementation](https://github.com/computationclub/game-of-life/tree/master/the-club) we all mobbed on to build as the 1st iteration
3. [The incomplete ruby implementation]() I wrote with [James](https://github.com/lazyatom) with the "No Arrays" constraint
