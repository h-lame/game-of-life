Unboxed had a developer away day in June 2016 and we ran a code retreat.

This solution was attempting to answer the constraint "No primitives across
language boundaries".  I paired with @tomsabin on this, but we didn't complete
it in time.  The problem stuck in my brain a bit so I took it home and spent
some time on it to finish it.
