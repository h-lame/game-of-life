## Conway's Game of Life

Over the years I've attended a bunch of [Code
retreats](http://coderetreat.org/) and although the rules of the event
state that you delete the code after each session sometimes
I haven't done that.  This repo collects a bunch of
[Conway's Game of Life](http://coderetreat.org/) implementations that I've been involved with
from these code retreats.
